# pdf-Splitter
This is a program which can be used to extract and create separate pdf's of medical patient's information (such as insurance cards, HIPPA/medical release forms, etc.) by looking up a single patient or from a folder of multiple patient's files. 

The goal of this program is to help automate creating many pdf files of patients at once. 

This program was inspired by my job in January 2022 when I worked as a medical assistant in a small medical company:
